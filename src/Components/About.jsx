          Hello! I'm Rufan, a passionate young developer specializing in
          full-stack development. Currently, I'm focused on full-stack software
          development and working on various projects. My main goal is to use
          technology in a creative and useful way. I spend most of my time in my
          own world, and this helps me gain inspiration to work on new ideas and
          structured approaches. I enjoy collaborating with friends and my team
          to explore new ideas. I'm excited to share my projects and experiences
          with you through my portfolio website. If you'd like to collaborate,
          feel free to reach out!
